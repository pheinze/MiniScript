// This Script show's random messages and writes them with a typewriter effect.
// In the first part it generates a map where you can add as many messages as you want.
// r2 generates a random number between 1 and the amount of messages (items of the map (.len)).
// In line 8 and 9 you can modify the numbers (/1 and *1 !together) of the letters that will show with every new frame (messageBox).
// t makes a random time between 0 and 0.l seconds multiplied with a random number between 0 and 2
